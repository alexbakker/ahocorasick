ahocorasick
===========

A Golang implementation of the Aho-Corasick string matching algorithm.

This is a fork of CloudFlare's [ahocorasick
package](https://github.com/cloudflare/ahocorasick), modified to return all
matches of all keywords, and the exact index at which they were found in the
text.
